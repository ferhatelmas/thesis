\chapter{Databases In Action}

In this section, we recreate dashboard example, which is used to explain limitations of ZODB, to interpolate complexity. Since we did a survey a great number of databases, we couldn't do it for each database. That's why strongest candidates are chosen from each category; namely, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis and OrientDB.

\section{Document Oriented-Databases}

\subsection{MongoDB}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML]
  Collection 'users':
    [
      {
        "id": "user_1",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "events": [
          { "id": "event_1", "roles": ["attendee"] },
          { "id": "event_2", "roles": ["manager"] },
          { "id": "event_3", "roles": ["reviewer", "attendee"] }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": "user_2",
        "name": "John Smith",
        "events": [
          { "id": "event_2", "roles": "attendee" }
        ]
      }

        "title": "TEDxCERN",
        "timestamp": 12377
      }
    ]
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection*{Conclusion}

Pros:
Good documentation, big community and successful examples (Sourceforge, eBay, Forbes, CERN)
Javascript and JSON are first class citizens
Replication (auto-failover with replica sets) and sharding (built-in)
In-place updates
Built by most valuable open source startup
Aggregation Framework and Map-Reduce
Cons:

Lack of transactions
Unsafe writes by design (data loss possibility unless be sure of propagation)
Not fast comparable to expectations, even if constraints are loosened to gain speed
Memory constraints (document size, working set, etc.)
Possible Use-Cases:

User-account details management:
Requires medium heavy of read and writes
Required
Conference details management:
Much more read than write
Installation management:
Tracking indico installations needs flexible schema, since tracked properties may change frequently by new versions

\section{Key-Value Store}

\subsection{Redis}

The \textit{Redis schema} (if fair to say) that was used for our implementation of the dashboard feature was the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
  avatar_event_roles: (<AVATAR_ID>, <EVENT_ID>) -> SET(ROLE)
  event_avatars: <EVENT_ID> -> SET(AVATAR)
  avatar_events: <AVATAR_ID> -> SORTED_SET(EVENT_TS -> EVENT_ID)
\end{lstlisting}

The first namespace establishes a link between an avatar and an event, much like named edges of a graph. The second one ($event_avatars$) maps a particular event to a set of avatars (so that we can have a quick list of all the people involved in a specific event), while $avatar_events$ does the opposite (maps an avatar to all the events it's connected to) with a little twist: events will be ordered by timestamp. This makes it easier to retrieve an ordered list of events relative to a particular user.

Here is the representation of the example Dashboard we've shown before using this schema:
\begin{lstlisting}
  avatar_event_roles: (user_1, event_1) -> attendee
                      (user_1, event_2) -> manager
                      (user_1, event_3) -> reviewer, attendee
                      (user_2, event_2) -> attendee

  event_avatars: event_1 -> user_1,
                 event_2 -> user_1, user_2
                 event_3 -> user_1

  avatar_events: user_1 -> 12345 -> event_1
                           12365 -> event_2
                           12377 -> event_3
                 user_2 -> 12345 -> event_2
\end{lstlisting}

There are a series of operations that need to be executed over this "schema":

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Adding a new role} (involves all the three namespaces)
  \item \textbf{Getting all the events in a specific time interval}, with the respective role information (involves $avatar_events$ and $avatar_event_roles$)
  \item \textbf{Deleting an event} (involves all three namespaces)
  \item \textbf{Deleting an avatar} (involves all three namespaces)
  \item \textbf{Deleting a role link} (involves all three namespaces)
  \item \textbf{Updating event time} (involves $event_avatars$ and $avatar_events$)
  \item \textbf{Merging avatars} (involves all three namespaces)
\end{itemize}
In this particular implementation, most of the work is done client-side, using LUA scripts (similar to \textit{stored procedures}). This really speeds up query times, but has the inconvenience of locking the server, thus not allowing anything else to run in parallel. This can be problematic in the case of slow scripts.

The operations shown above have quite reasonable time complexity boundaries: Redis guarantees at least linear time in almost all operations, and most hash-related operations are logarithmic. \textit{Set} and \textit{get} of single values tend to be executed in constant time. A possible \textit{worst-case scenario} could be \textit{deleting an event} when all users are connected to all events. This would imply going over all users in $event_avatars[deleted_event]$ and deleting them from $avatar_events$ ($O(log(N)$)) as well as $avatar_event_roles$ ($O(1)$). This results in $O(Nlog(N))$.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}

Redis is a simple, fast and highly powerful key-value store. It is very versatile and can be used to solve a large set of problems. Its simplicity is, however, indicative of the role that it should occupy in an application stack. Its memory-oriented nature makes it ideal for caching and other use cases that require storing short-lived data (even though this data can be persisted) and the "key-value" philosophy that is behind it makes it hard to model complex relations using the simple data structures that are provided. There are sites successfully [using Redis as their primary DB][2], but the complexity of their DB schema cannot be compared to that of Indico's.

It is, then, clear that Redis would be a viable option in a "double database" scenario (primary DB using a different technology), in which it would act as a cache or possible primary storage for "simple" information that could be easily decoupled from the applications' business logic. Examples of that are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Cached JSON objects (already used)
  \item Web Session information (already used, >=1.2)
  \item Cached templates
  \item Job scheduler tasks
  \item Plugin cache (plugins that are available, corresponding extension points...)
  \item Short URL registry
  \item Other possible cases could be:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item User account information
    \item Versioned minute storage
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
